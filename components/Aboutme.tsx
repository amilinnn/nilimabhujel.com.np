          Hello! I'm Nilima, a passionate and creative graphic and UI/UX
          Designer, With a strong foundation in design principles and a keen eye
          for detail, I specialize in creating visually appealing and
          user-friendly designs that leave a lasting impact. I strive to blend
          aesthetics with functionality.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-5">
          I'm a user-centered designer who believes that the best designs are
          created with the user in mind. I use a variety of research methods to
          understand user needs and pain points, and I use that information to
          create designs that are both effective and enjoyable to use.
